# Connect Demo Service: Eliza

Eliza is an example RPC service built with [`connect-go`][connect-go].

The service emulates the DOCTOR script written for Joseph Weizenbaum's 1966
[ELIZA natural language processing system][eliza]. It responds to your
statements as a stereotypical psychotherapist might; since the original program
was a demonstration of the superficiality of human-computer communication, the
therapy is not very convincing.

For more on Connect, see the [announcement blog post][blog], the documentation
on [connect.build][docs], or the [`connect-go`][connect-go] repo.
